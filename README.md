# Aggregation-Filtering-Rank
We will perform some very high level aggregation and filtering operations on covid and disaster datasets. Then, we will apply ranking on the results for some tasks and visualize to get some intuition about the data. Pandas has a convenient and powerful syntax for aggregation, filtering, and ranking. Also used weka Visualizer to visualize disaster dataset and pre-process if contains any errors.
